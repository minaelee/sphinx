Welcome to Minae's Sphinx Test Docs
===================================

**Hi, I'm Minae!**
I spun up this page using the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation generator along with the `ReadTheDocs <https://about.readthedocs.com/>`_ documentation hosting platform.

Sphinx is a documentation generator that's often used with Python projects. It supports multiple output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, and PDF. Its pages (like this one) are created using a markup language called `ReStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_. Files written with ReStructuredText use the **.rst** extension. 

Sphinx is a static site generator (SSG), so you can deploy it through many services, including GitHub Pages, Netlify, and the other usual suspects when it comes to SSG hosting. However, most people choose to deploy Sphinx sites through `ReadTheDocs <https://about.readthedocs.com/>`_ because it's a platform that specifically supports Sphinx.
